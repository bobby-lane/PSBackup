# PSBackup

The file in the repository are a collection of PowerShell scripts and functions that I use to backup key files and folders.
This is not a PowerShell module that you can download and install.
The code is very specific to my needs, but I have had requests to make the code more easily available.
You are welcome to use anything in the repository as reference material for your own projects, but everything is offered **as is with no guarantees** any of the code will work for you.

You can read more about the code in these blog posts.
